To be fair, I'm not quite sure what I intend to do here. I am not fully sure why I 
wanted to make a website. I guess that the answer is non-unique.

Since I am on a 3h train from London to Plymouth, I've had the time to come up with
the following reasons, that I've decided to order in decreasing level of importance.

1. I know it's super cliche, but I enjoy making things. Or, maybe, I just get a lot 
of pride from the stuff I make.
2. Vanity. Every blog out there stands on an original sin; thinking that it has
something to say and (worse yet) there are people out there willing to listen. 
3. Every cool kid has a blog or website nowadays. Even job applications ask you for 
your personal website. Well, I'll have one now.
4. I know very little about web development and I wanted to learn a bit more.
5. An appreciation for having an independent platform to post whatever I want. 
I even considered self-hosting the website, but Cloudflare makes it not worth the hassle. 

To be honest, I don't have any expectations from this blog. It's mostly something that 
I'll do for fun.

## Who I am
I currently work as a Data Scientist in London. Data Scientist is a broad job title, which 
means different things in different companies. For me, it means that I am in charge of
building software applications using machine learning. The core of what I do is 
statistics and machine learning, but it often also involves a bit of design and engineering.

I landed into data science from physics, following a path laid by many 
before me. I took that turn after finishing my PhD on theoretical physics. In case it is 
of interest, said phd was about the _double copy_, a mysterious relationship between
gravity and gauge theories.

## My interests
Probably my interests will guide the contents of the blog:
- Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and data science more broadly.
- Theoretical Physics (I have a PhD on this)
- Statistics and Mathematics
- DIY Electronics. I learned about the basics of electronics during my undergrad, but 
never had the opportunity to anything useful with it. Recently, I've started 
to tinker with it again, and it's a lot of fun.
- Recently started learning about economics. I've always regarded it almost as a 
pseudo-science, and something quite boring to learn. I just imagine that 
most economics were memorising initialisms and computing percentages. To be 
fair, I think that was due to how it was taught at school. However, the 
nature of my adult life and seeing the evolution of AI first hand have sparked
my interest in it.
